# The AI Lies They DON'T Want You To See

Remember the internet's promise? A decentralized utopia of knowledge and
collaboration?

**Now look around.** Walled gardens, algorithmic manipulation, and constant
surveillance are the reality.

## Are we making the same mistake with AI?

Everywhere you turn, the hype machine is churning. "Revolutionary" AI! LLMs that
will write our code, compose symphonies, even achieve consciousness! But behind
the dazzling demos and breathless pronouncements, a darker truth is lurking...
**one of deception, hidden agendas, and outright lies.**

Think I'm exaggerating? Buckle up, because you're about to see the evidence the
AI hype machine doesn't want you to see:

- **Remember Tesla's "self-driving" car demo back in 2016?** It was staged.
  Humans were controlling the car from behind the scenes. This isn't ancient
  history – it's happening _right now_. Google's recent "Gemini" AI demo? Also
  riddled with fakery.
- **Even OpenAI, the golden child of the AI world, isn't immune.** That "90th
  percentile" bar exam score that everyone was raving about? Turns out they
  gamed the system to make their AI look smarter than it is.
- **And don't get me started on "AI washing."** Companies slapping "AI-powered"
  on everything to inflate their stock prices, even if there's barely a line of
  AI code involved. The SEC is cracking down – a sure sign that this deception
  is rampant.

**But wait, there's more!**

- Google's DeepMind brags about creating millions of new materials. Independent
  researchers call BS. Google's Bard suggests we eat rocks and put glue in our
  pizza (seriously).
- We know AI systems are riddled with bias because they're trained on our biased
  data. But when these systems operate in black boxes, we're powerless to
  identify and correct the harm they're causing.

## The result? A growing erosion of trust

When "AI" turns out to be smoke, mirrors, and exploited human labor (remember
Amazon's "Just Walk Out" technology?), it makes us question the entire field.

**The Hype Machine Wants You To Be A Passive Consumer.** They want you to
believe that bigger, faster models are the inevitable, unstoppable future. But
speed and scale are meaningless without accuracy, transparency, and a commitment
to ethical development.

**And right now, those are in dangerously short supply.**

## There's a Better Way: Manage Your Own Agents

Instead of handing over control to corporations with opaque agendas, we need to
champion a different kind of AI. One that is open, decentralized, and puts the
power back in the hands of individuals.

This means:

- **No More Black Boxes:** We deserve to know how AI systems are built, what
  data they're trained on, and how they make decisions.
- **Ethics Over Profits:** AI development should be guided by human values, not
  just the pursuit of bigger profits.
- **Empowerment, Not Dependency:** Imagine a world where we all have the tools
  to build and control our own AI agents, tailored to our specific needs and
  values.

**This is the vision behind AgentFlow.**
