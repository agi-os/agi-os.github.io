        AGI OS is built with a modern tech stack that combines a powerful
        front-end experience with a secure and flexible backend, all designed to
        make building and deploying AI agents easier than ever before.

        Front-end Magic with React and Node-Based UI
      </h3>
      <p>
        The front-end UI, where you design and interact with your agents, is
        built using React. We leverage the intuitive and visual power of the
        React Node library to provide a seamless workflow for connecting
        different components in your agents' decision-making processes. This
        allows for a clear and understandable representation of even the most
        complex AI systems.

        Secure and Flexible Backend with Node.js
      </h3>
      <p>
        The backend, responsible for handling your data and connecting to large
        language models (LLMs), is built with Node.js. This choice ensures:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Security:</strong> Your private API keys and sensitive data are
          handled securely, kept separate from the front-end for enhanced protection.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Flexibility:</strong> You can easily connect to both cloud-based
          LLMs and models running locally on your machine.
        </li>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8">
      Open Source and Continuously Evolving
    </h3>
    <p>
      We believe in the power of open source. The AGI OS codebase is publicly
      available, allowing developers to contribute, extend its functionality,
      and build upon our foundation.
