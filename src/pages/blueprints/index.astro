        Imagine easily sharing and replicating your most ingenious automation
        workflows â€“ that's the power of AGI OS Blueprints. Think of them as
        shareable recipes for automation success!
      </p>

      <p>
        Just like a wiring diagram clearly shows how to connect electrical
        components, a Blueprint captures the structure and logic of your AGI OS
        setup. It includes:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The layout of all your nodes (the building blocks of your automation).
        </li>
        <li>
          The connections between those nodes (how data flows and actions are
          triggered).
        </li>
        <li>
          The individual settings and configurations for each node (fine-tuning
          your automation).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>With Blueprints, you can:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Copy and paste</b> parts of your automation within AgentFlow for easy
          reuse.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Share your best solutions</b> with the AGI OS community and help others
          automate smarter.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Discover a library of proven blueprints</b> for common tasks and industries,
          saving you time and effort.
        </li>
      </ul>
